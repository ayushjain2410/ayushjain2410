<h3>Hi, I'm Ayush Jain 👋</h3>

I an undergraduate from Delhi Technological University(India) pursuing Production Engineering. While being in this field, I am also learning
technical skills on side, and hence trying to gain an overall versatile experience in different domains .

🌱 I am exploring my way into Python and C++ languages and also solving problems on Hackerrank to supplement my knowledge with hands on concepts like data
structures and algorithms. I have also made several projects in the same domain like

* Flappy Bird Game in Python using PYGAME module
* Tic Tac Toe game using c++
* Restaurant website using HTML and CSS
* Mini Jarvis using Python with Speech Recognition module

👀 The listed projects above are also the testimony to the efforts I am putting in gaining the experience of real applications.With these two languages, my other areas of interests 
are 
<h3>C, Javascript, Mysql, MongoDB and Nodejs.</h3>

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the development projects in Python / C++ languages or collaborate on Wed-Dev projects.

My previous and some of the current experiences include:

* Technical Head for the event 🙍 DIGIT.4.0 in high school.
* Member at RotaractDTU & TEDxDTU at college
* Team member at MACS, a technical society in college .
